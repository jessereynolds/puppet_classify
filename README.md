# PuppetComply

## WARNING

This is a work in progress and will probably cause you to burst into flames. Use at your own risk.

This gem seeks to provide a mechamism to test arbritrary Puppet modules for compliance against some security spec. The modules under test must contain rspec tests for this gem to inject the rspec shared examples into.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'puppet_comply'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install puppet_comply

## Usage

Initialise a new set of compliace tests:

```
puppet_comply init
```

Add that resulting directory to a git repo so that you can use it as follows:

```
# download your general purpose compliance tests
git clone git://git.example/foo/compliance_tests.git

# check any module for compliance with your tests
cd compliance_tests
puppet_comply check --forge puppetlabs/ntp # or specify --git git url, branch, tag, ... something
```

Uses [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/voxpupuli/librarian-puppet) to resolve and install dependencies declared in metadata.json from the Puppet Forge.
